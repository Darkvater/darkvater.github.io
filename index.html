							<div>Experienced agile developer with a very low pain threshold for manual processes. Technology is an enabler to help automate repetitive tasks, be it for production or testing purposes, not only for solving business challenges. Performs short iterative releases to deliver quickly by leaning heavily on TDD, BDD, and CI to ensure code quality and enable refactoring to ward off code rot. Firmly believes in full-stack feature development and the dev-ops model where ownership is given to developers to test, implement, release and support the product. As a lead and manager, gives a lot of space to team to develop the most suitable solutions. Constantly coaches/supports team especially around code design and writing good, meaningful and reusable tests.</div>

								It would not be very useful to list out everything I have used in my career. My view is that languages, libraries and technologies are tools to achieve a desired business outcome and should be chosen as appropriate. Current favourite combination is <i>Quarkus, Kotlin, Cucumber using IntelliJ and running on Gitlab pipelines</i>.</p>

Responsible for building out a workflow engine connecting a multitude of applications focusing on designing and building services that are transparent, auditable and extensible. Influencing and supporting other teams, I have proactively taken on the migration of services owned by the Quants Engineers to unblock and drive forward the overall program. I worked closely with the team on the secondary trade offering and produced a service that was simpler, and cleaner as well as resolving a number of issues all detected through thorough reconciliation and testing.

Have delivered a multitude of features on the 14+ year old platform including support for additional markets, new product enhancements, cross-market basket execution, fine-grained access entitlements, platform technology upgrades, etc. with a small team of engineers. This is only possible because of firm guiding principles around clean code, test-driven development and rigorous automation.</li>
