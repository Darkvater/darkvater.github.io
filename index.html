							<h6>Dynamic Agile Developer with a Strong Focus on Automation and Continuous Improvement</h6>
							<div>As an accomplished full-stack Agile Developer, I specialize in leveraging technology to deliver value by streamlining and automating manual processes, enhancing efficiency in both production and testing environments. I focus on business outcomes through short iterative releases, leveraging TDD, BDD, and CI to ensure high code quality and facilitate effective refactoring.</p>
							As a leader and manager, I foster an environment that encourages my team to explore and implement optimal solutions while providing ongoing coaching and support, particularly in code design and the creation of meaningful, reusable tests. I advocate for full-stack feature development and embrace the DevOps model, empowering my team to take ownership of the entire product lifecycle — from testing and implementation to release and support. </div>

						<li>I am leading Regulatory Services globally driving the modernisation of a legacy suite of services into a scalable technology stack, I implemented fundamental process improvements while extending the strategic <span class="dynamic-content" title="These services are at the centre of the pre-trade offering across both the Listed and OTC worlds and used by hundreds of Relationship Managers (RM), External Asset Managers (EAM), and Direct Access Clients (DAC), in- and outside of Switzerland. The performance and correct (explainable, auditable) behaviour is crucial for the bank’s compliance towards regulators (FinMA) and ensures clients are recommended products suitable for their profile/preferences.">service offering.</span> Collaborating closely with the platform team I ensure new requirements are architecturally sound and integrated seamlessly while maintaining current operations under tight budget and staffing constraints.</li>
						<li>I have added automated CI/CD pipelines, enhanced system robustness by fixing and adding extensive feature and integration tests, allowing for the refactoring/rewriting of numerous critical <span class="dynamic-content" title="Most of the technology stack was rewritten from Java to Kotlin to leverage its advanced features including data classes, delegation, lambdas, and compile-time nullability checks. Where Kotlin was not feasible, I ensured Lombok support was added instead. Where heavy scripting - especially PL/SQL stored procedures - was used, I added tests, moved it under souce control, ensured validation and enabled automatic deployments.">functionalities.</span> Identified and resolved multiple concurrency and other hidden issues surfaced through testing automation, resulting in a smooth and reliable system performance.</li>
						<li>In parallel I implemented a new microservice-based rule engine with a clear separation of data and business logic, utilizing an in-house built DSL. The solution is designed from the outset with auditability, traceability, replayability, performance, and cost-efficiency as core principles. Leveraging reactive programming frameworks in Quarkus, Mutiny Vert.x, Redis, and MongoDB implemented in Kotlin on OpenShift, I ensured the system was highly responsive and scalable. I built proxies safeguard existing APIs' functionality, allowing timely delivery of new features at the fraction of previously needed <span class="dynamic-content" title="Just as an example the timeline of integrating Sustainable Finance dropped from 6+ months to about 2 weeks including a 100% feature test coverage compared to barely any tests available previously.">resources.</span></li>

Responsible for building out a workflow engine connecting a multitude of applications focusing on designing and building services that are transparent, auditable and extensible. Influencing and supporting other teams, I have proactively taken on the migration of services owned by Quants Engineers to unblock and drive forward the overall program. I worked closely with the quants on the secondary trade offering and produced a service that was simpler, cleaner, as well as resolving a number of legacy issues all detected through thorough reconciliation and testing.
